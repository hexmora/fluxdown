# @fluxdown/mdast

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- aa2a08f: Allow compatible internal dependency updates through caret version ranges instead
  of exact version pins. Future updates within those ranges can be installed without
  releasing unchanged dependent packages. Existing consumer lockfiles must still be
  updated to resolve newer dependency versions.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 1242fc4: Initial release with extensible Markdown rendering for streaming content, framework-independent processing, and React integrations with Shad tail shading and smooth rendering.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1242fc4]
